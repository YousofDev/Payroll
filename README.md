# Payroll System

A robust, scalable, and secure payroll management system built with modern technologies to streamline employee management, payroll processing, and financial operations. This application is designed to handle user authentication, employee records, salary calculations, additions, deductions, and payslip generation with a focus on performance, security, and maintainability. It leverages TypeScript, Express.js, PostgreSQL, and Drizzle ORM, with a fully containerized setup using Docker and automated CI/CD pipelines via GitHub Actions.

## üõ†Ô∏è Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js** (v18 or higher)
- **Docker** and **Docker Compose** for containerized setup
- **PostgreSQL** for local database (if not using Docker)
- **pnpm** for package management
- **GitHub account** for CI/CD

### Local Development Setup

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd payroll-system
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:

   ```bash
   pnpm install
   ```

3. **Set up environment variables**: Run the provided setup script to create a `.env` file and initialize databases:

   ```bash
   chmod +x setup-local.sh
   ./setup-local.sh
   ```

   This script:

   - Creates a `.env` file with default configurations.
   - Initializes `payroll` and `testpayroll` databases.
   - Starts Docker containers for production and test databases.
   - Runs migrations for both databases.
   - Starts the application.

4. **Run the application manually** (if not using `setup-local.sh`):

   - Start Docker containers:

     ```bash
     docker compose up -d
     ```

   - Run migrations:

     ```bash
     ./migrate.sh
     ```

   - Start the application:

     ```bash
     pnpm run dev
     ```

5. **Access the application**:
   - API URL: `http://localhost:4000/api/v1`

## üß™ Testing

The application is fully tested with:

- **Unit Tests**: Covering controllers, services, and utilities.

- **Integration Tests**: Testing API endpoints with the test database.

- Run tests using:

  ```bash
  pnpm run test
  ```

To clear the Jest cache:

```bash
pnpm run clear_jest
```

---

## üöÄ Deployment

The project includes a GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline that:

- Runs tests on every push/pull request.
- Builds and deploys the application using Docker.
- Executes migrations for production and test databases.

### Deployment Steps

1. Configure environment variables in `.env` (see `.env.example`).
2. Set up GitHub Actions secrets (e.g., `DB_PASSWORD`, `ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET` etc.).
3. Push changes to the `main` branch to trigger the pipeline.

### Docker Deployment

- Build and run with Docker Compose:

  ```bash
  docker compose up --build -d
  ```

- Run migrations:

  ```bash
  ./migrate.sh
  ```

## üóÑÔ∏è Database Management

- **Drizzle ORM**: Used for type-safe schema definitions and migrations.

- **Migration Scripts**:

- Production migrations: `pnpm run migrate:prod`

- Test migrations: `pnpm run migrate:test`

### Run both: `./migrate.sh`

- **Databases**:

  - Production: `payroll` (port 5432)
  - Test: `testpayroll` (port 5433)
